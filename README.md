# 6.887 Machine Learning for Systems
## Lab 2: Smart Caching using Bayesian Optimization

###### Due: Friday, Oct 8 at 12:00 PM

### Instructions:

### Step 1

Clone this repository with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/jialinding/6.887Lab2.git
cd 6.887Lab2
```

### Step 2

If your Python version is at least 3.8, then you can directly use pip to install the required packages:
```
python3 -m pip install jupyter numpy scikit-optimize cloudpickle
```

However, if your Python version is less than 3.8, or if you prefer to use an environment, use the following commands to create a conda environment and install required packages
```
conda create --name lab2_mlforsys python=3.8
conda activate lab2_mlforsys
conda install jupyter numpy cloudpickle
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-optimize
```


### Step 3
Launch jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 4
Once completed, upload your notebook through Canvas. If you do not have access to Canvas, email your completed notebook directly to Jialin (jialind@mit.edu) and Pouya (pouyah@mit.edu).
